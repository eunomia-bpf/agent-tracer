# AgentSight: Future Plans and Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements and future plans for the AgentSight project. The ideas are categorized to provide a clear roadmap for development.

## 1. Collector Framework Enhancements

The Rust-based collector framework is the core of AgentSight's data processing pipeline. Enhancing its flexibility and capabilities will enable more sophisticated analysis and a wider range of use cases.

*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Implement a mechanism for dynamically loading and updating runner and analyzer configurations without restarting the collector. This could be achieved through a configuration file watcher or a dedicated API endpoint.
*   **Advanced Stream Merging:** Enhance the `CombinedRunner` with more sophisticated stream merging strategies. For example, a `TimeOrdered` strategy could use a priority queue to merge events from multiple streams in strict chronological order.
*   **Stateful Analyzers:** Introduce support for stateful analyzers that can maintain state across events. This would enable more complex analysis, such as tracking the state of a process or a network connection over time.
*   **Dead Letter Queue:** Implement a dead letter queue for events that fail to be processed by an analyzer. This would prevent data loss and allow for later analysis of failed events.
*   **Plugin System:** Develop a formal plugin system for analyzers and runners. This would allow third-party developers to extend AgentSight's functionality without modifying the core codebase.

## 2. eBPF Program Enhancements

The eBPF programs are responsible for capturing data at the kernel level. Expanding their scope and detail will provide a more comprehensive view of agent behavior.

*   **Network-level Metrics:** In addition to SSL/TLS traffic, capture network-level metrics such as TCP retransmissions, packet loss, and round-trip time. This would provide a more complete picture of network performance.
*   **File I/O Monitoring:** Enhance the `process` eBPF program to monitor file I/O operations in more detail. This could include tracking the number of bytes read and written, the files being accessed, and the processes performing the I/O.
*   **GPU Monitoring:** For AI agents that use GPUs, develop an eBPF program to monitor GPU utilization, memory usage, and kernel execution time. This would provide insights into the performance of the agent's model inference.
*   **Cross-platform Support:** While eBPF is Linux-specific, explore options for providing similar functionality on other platforms, such as using DTrace on macOS or Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) on Windows.

## 3. Frontend and Visualization

The frontend is the primary interface for users to interact with the data collected by AgentSight. Improving its usability and adding new visualization features will make the data more accessible and insightful.

*   **Real-time Dashboard:** Develop a real-time dashboard that provides a high-level overview of agent behavior. This could include metrics such as the number of active agents, the rate of LLM API calls, and the most frequently used tools.
*   **Trace Visualization:** Enhance the trace visualization to provide a more detailed and intuitive view of agent behavior. This could include features such as a timeline view, a flame graph of function calls, and a dependency graph of agent interactions.
*   **Log Correlation:** Implement a feature for correlating logs from different sources, such as the agent's application logs, the eBPF programs, and the collector framework. This would make it easier to debug issues that span multiple components.
*   **Alerting:** Add support for configurable alerts that notify users when certain conditions are met, such as a sudden increase in the rate of LLM API calls or a high number of failed tool executions.

## 4. Developer Experience and Usability

Improving the developer experience and usability of AgentSight will make it easier for developers to get started with the project and to use it effectively.

*   **Simplified Installation:** Provide a one-line installation script that automates the process of installing the necessary dependencies and building the project.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Expand the documentation to include more detailed tutorials, examples, and API references.
*   **Configuration Wizard:** Develop a configuration wizard that guides users through the process of configuring the collector framework and eBPF programs.
*   **Pre-built Binaries:** Provide pre-built binaries for the eBPF programs and the collector framework for common Linux distributions.

## 5. Security and Reliability

Hardening AgentSight against potential vulnerabilities and failures is crucial for its adoption in production environments.

*   **Data Redaction:** Implement a data redaction analyzer that can be used to remove sensitive information from the collected data, such as API keys and personal identifiable information (PII).
*   **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Add support for RBAC to the frontend and API server. This would allow administrators to control who has access to the collected data and what actions they can perform.
*   **High Availability:** Implement a high-availability mode for the collector framework that uses a distributed architecture to ensure that data collection and analysis can continue even if one or more components fail.
*   **End-to-end Encryption:** Ensure that all data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

## 6. New Features

Proposing new capabilities to expand the scope of AgentSight.

*   **Automated Anomaly Detection:** Develop an analyzer that uses machine learning to automatically detect anomalies in agent behavior, such as a sudden change in the agent's persona or a deviation from its expected workflow.
*   **Causality Analysis:** Implement a causality analysis engine that can identify the root cause of a problem by analyzing the relationships between different events.
*   **Integration with Other Observability Tools:** Develop integrations with other observability tools, such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger. This would allow users to correlate AgentSight data with data from other sources.
*   **Support for Other AI Frameworks:** While AgentSight is framework-neutral, develop specific integrations for popular AI frameworks such as LangChain, AutoGen, and gemini-cli. This would make it even easier to use AgentSight with these frameworks.
